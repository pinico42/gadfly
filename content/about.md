# About

GadFly attended Winchester School of Art and then Goldsmith’s College after which she successfully exhibited her drawings and paintings as well as undertaking illustration commissions. Her beautiful work has been produced for clients such as The Arts Council, British Airways, Esso, Wiggins Teape, Dorling Kindersley, Veuve Cliquet, The Tatler, The Royal Ballet, Corney and Barrow and many more.

Her work has a wonderful lightness of touch and can be joyful and inspirational. She works with passion and feels strongly that all children, whatever their background, should have the freedom to explore their creativity and individuality, and for that reason has set up this website to offer her work to be freely downloaded with the intention for those who are able to to donate, in the hope that children’s artistic expression may benefit by being nurtured in peaceful surroundings. The work is often of erotic nature and is therefore not appropriate for children to see, however the hope is that the money from the drawings can be used for a good cause and can benefit those who need it the most.

As the gadfly movement gains momentum we will update this website with how the donations are being used to allow children to reach their creative potential.
